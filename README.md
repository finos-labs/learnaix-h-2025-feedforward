## üìÑ Summary of Your Solution (under 150 words)

**What problem does your solution solve?**  
Our solution tackles the challenge of unstructured and hard-to-analyze student feedback in Moodle. Instructors often lack actionable insights to improve teaching quality and course design in real time.  

**How does it work?**  
Feedback submitted in Moodle is captured via a custom plugin and passed to a Next.js API. The data is stored in Snowflake, where AI enrichment extracts sentiment, themes, and actionable suggestions. A Next.js dashboard then displays key metrics, while an AI chatbot powered by Snowflake Cortex Llama3 answers instructor queries based on enriched data.  

**What technologies did you use?**  
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Recharts
- **Backend/API:** Next.js serverless routes  
- **Data & AI:** Snowflake (storage, enrichment, Cortex Llama3)  
- **Integration:** Moodle plugin for feedback transfer
